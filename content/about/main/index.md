 I thought I needed a space to organize my rants and ramblings. I was already fighting my daily battles with R. The result of this churn is this personal space where I can document my learnings, which also doubles up as a void I can scream into.   
   
   I don't take this space seriously. Hence, I strongly encourage not to take me or my writing seriously and come at me with sophisticated arguments. The only weapons I have in my aresenal are memes, and memes are not sophisticated. They are crude and absurdist symbols of man's inability to grasp complex topics --- like god. The key takeaway from this website is: Memes are divine.
